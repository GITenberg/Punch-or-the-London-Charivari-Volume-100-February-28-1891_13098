    <h2>SPECIMENS FROM MR. PUNCH'S SCAMP-ALBUM.</h2>

    <h4>No. II.&mdash;THE LITERARY "GHOST."</h4>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:33%;">
        <a href="images/97-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/97-1.png"
             alt="Elderly lady." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>We will assume, simply for the purposes of this argument,
    that you, reader, are an innocent-minded elderly lady, and a
    regular subscriber to the Local Circulating Library. You are
    sitting by your comfortable fireside, knitting a "cross-over"
    for a Bazaar, when your little maid announces a gentleman, who
    says he has not a card-case with him, but requests that you
    will see him.</p>

    <p>"You are sure he <i>is</i> a gentleman, MARY ANN?" you will
    inquire, with a slight uneasiness as to the umbrellas in the
    hall.</p>

    <p>"Oh, a puffict gentleman, Mam," says MARY ANN&mdash;"with a
    respirator."</p>

    <p>Upon this testimony to his social standing, you direct that
    the perfect gentleman shall be shown in.</p>

    <p>MARY ANN has not deceived you&mdash;he has a respirator,
    also blue spectacles, and a red nose. He apologises with fluent
    humility for intruding upon you without the honour of a
    previous acquaintance, and takes a chair, after which he shifts
    his respirator to his chin, sheds a pair of immense woollen
    gloves into his hat, and produces a bundle of papers, over
    which he intreats you to cast an eye. On perusing them, they
    prove to be letters from various eminent authors, whose names
    are, more or less, familiar to you. These documents are more
    interesting as autographs than from any intrinsic literary
    merit, for they all refer to remittances for various amounts,
    and regret politely that the writer is not in a position to
    obtain permanent employment for his correspondent. While you
    are reading them, your visitor pays assiduous court to your
    cat&mdash;which impresses you favourably.</p>

    <p>"Possibly, Madam," he suggests, "you may be personally
    acquainted with some of those gentlemen?" When you confess that
    you have not that honour, he seems more at his ease.</p>

    <p>"I asked," he says, "because I have long heard of you as a
    Lady of great taste and judgment in literary
    matters&mdash;which, after seeing you, I can the more readily
    understand."</p>

    <p>It is a fact that several of your nieces and female
    neighbours are in the habit of declaring that they would rather
    take your opinion on a novel than that of all the critics;
    still, you had not expected your fame to have spread so
    wide.</p>

    <p>"I had another motive," he confesses, "because, if you were
    intimate with any of these authors, I should naturally 'esitate
    to say anything which might have the effect of altering your
    opinion of them. As it is, I can speak with perfect
    freedom&mdash;though in the strictest confidence. You see
    before you, Madam, an unfortunate bean, whom circumstances have
    'itherto debarred from ever reaping the fruit of his own brine!
    Well may you remark, 'Your Gracious Goodness'"&mdash;(<i>your
    natural astonishment having escaped you in the shape of this
    invocation</i>)&mdash;"for in your goodness and in your
    graciousness rests my sole remaining 'ope. I was endowed from
    an early age with a fertile and versatile imagination, and
    creative powers which, without vanity, I may say, were of a
    rather superior class. The one thing I lacked was inflooence,
    and in the world of letters, Madam, as I am sure you do not
    need to be informed, without inflooence Genius is denied a
    suitable opening. At several literary Clubs in the West End I
    made the acquaintance of the authors whose letters you have
    just had the opportunity of reading&mdash;men who have since
    attained to the topmost pinnacle of Fame. At that time they
    were comparatively obscure; they 'eard my conversation, they
    realised that I 'ad ideers, of which they knew the value
    better, perhaps, than I did myself. I used to see them taking
    down notes on their shirt-cuffs, and that, but I took no notice
    of it at the time. Probably you have read the celebrated work
    of fiction by Mr. GASHLEIGH WALKER, entitled, <i>King Cole's
    Cellars</i>? I thought so. I gave him the plot, scenery and
    characters complete, for that story. I did, indeed."</p>

    <p>"And do you mean to say he has taken all the credit
    himself!" you exclaim, very properly shocked.</p>

    <p>"If he has," he replies, meekly, "I am far from
    complaining&mdash;a shilling or two was an object to me at that
    time. And it got me more work of the sort. There's <i>Booty
    Bay</i>, now, the book that made ROBERTSON&mdash;<i>that</i>
    was took down, word for word, from my dictation, in a back
    parlour of one of LOCKHART's Cocoa-Rooms. I got fifteen
    shillings for that. <i>He</i> got, I daresay, 'undreds of
    pounds. Well, <i>I</i> don't grudge it to him. As he said, I
    ought to remember he had all the <i>manual</i> labour of it.
    Then there's that other book which has sold its thousands,
    <i>Four Men in a Funny</i>&mdash;that was mine&mdash;all but
    the last chapter; he <i>would</i> put in that, and, in
    <i>my</i> opinion, spoilt it, from an artistic point. But what
    could I do? It was out of <i>my</i> 'ands! I must say I never
    anticipated myself that it would be so popular. 'I should be
    robbing you,' I said, 'if I took more than ten shillings for
    it.' All the same, it turned out a good bargain for him. Then
    there's the Drama, you would hardly credit it that I could name
    three leading theatres at this present moment where pieces are
    running which came originally out of <i>my</i> 'ed! But it's no
    use my saying so&mdash;no one would believe it. And now I've
    'elped all these men up the ladder, they can do without
    me&mdash;they can go alone&mdash;or think they can. See the way
    they write&mdash;not a word about owing anything to my 'umble
    services, a postal order for three-and-six; but that's the
    world all over!"</p>

    <p>"But surely," you will sympathetically observe, "you will
    expose them, you will insist on sharing in the reward of your
    labours&mdash;it is a duty you owe to the public, as well as
    yourself!"</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:36%;">
        <a href="images/97-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/97-2.png"
             alt="The perfect gentleman." /></a>"Slow rises worth
             by poverty depressed."
    </div>

    <p>"So I've been told, Madam. But what can I do?&mdash;I'm a
    poor man. 'Slow rises worth, by poverty depressed,' as POPE, or
    GOLDSMITH&mdash;for a similar idea occurs in both&mdash;truly
    observes. To put my case before the public as it <i>ought</i>
    to be put, I should first have to gain the ear of the
    Press&mdash;and you want a golden key to do that, nowadays. The
    Press is very reluctant to run down successful writers. 'Hawks
    won't pick out Awkses heyes,' as BURNS remarks. (<i>By this
    time you are probably fumbling for your purse, which, as usual,
    is at the bottom of your work-basket.</i>) No, they will find
    me out some day&mdash;after I'm dead and gone, most likely! In
    the meantime I envy nobody. I have the consciousness of Genius,
    and&mdash;I'm sure your generosity is overwhelming,
    Madam&mdash;I really never ventured to&mdash;Pardon these
    tears; it is the first time my poor talents have ever obtained
    such recognition as this! Could you crown your favours by
    giving me the names and addresses of any charitable friends and
    neighbours whom you think at all likely to follow your noble
    example?... I thank you from my heart, Madam, and, when I
    succeed in recovering my literary in'eritance, and am called
    upon to issue a collected edition of my works, I shall take the
    liberty of inscribing on the title-page a dedication to the
    generous benefactress who first 'elped to restore my fallen
    fortunes!"</p>

    <p>With this he seals his lips again with the respirator,
    pockets his documents and your donation, and bows himself
    gratefully out, leaving you to meditate on the unscrupulousness
    of popular Authors, and the ease with which a confiding public
    is hoodwinked.</p>

    <h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

    <p>ENGLISH HISTORY.&mdash;I have been reading several books on
    this subject, and am rather puzzled. Are the English people,
    <i>as existing now</i>, Teutons, or Danes, or Celts, or what?
    Can we be Teutons when the aborigines of these islands were not
    Teutonic? I feel that my own genius&mdash;and I have a
    lot&mdash;is Celtic; at the same time I have always prided
    myself on my Norman blood; yet from my liking for the sea,
    which never makes me sick, at least at Herne Bay, I fancy I
    must be descended from a Scandinavian Viking. What is the
    ethnological name given to a person who is an amalgamation of
    such heterogeneous elements?&mdash;INQUIRER.</p>

    <h4>No. XIV.&mdash;LE PÉTROLIUM; OU, LES SALOPERIES
    PARISIENNES.</h4>

    <p>(<i>Par Zorgon-Gola, Auteur de "Toujours Poivre," "Charbon
    et Crasse," "La Fange," "499 Pages d'Amour," "Le Pourvoyeur
    Universel," "Une Rêveuse qui vise l'Académie</i>.")</p>

    <h4>I.&mdash;LA FAMILLE.</h4>

    <p>Si vous voulez voir les <i>Slums</i> Parisiens et comprendre
    le Peuple&mdash;avec la majuscule&mdash;vous devez visiter les
    Saloperies, faubourg au delà de Belleville et de Ménilmontant,
    faubourg où les femmes sortent le matin en cheveux&mdash;ça ne
    veut pas dire comme Lady GODIVA, mais simplement sans
    chapeau&mdash;acheter de la charcuterie; et où vers minuit dans
    des bouges infects les hommes se coupent le gavion, en bons
    zigs, après une soirée de rigolade. C'est ici qu'on trouve des
    admirables exemplaires de cette nombreuse famille EGOU-OGWASH,
    qui, datant de PHARAMOND, peuple Paris et joue tous les rôles
    dans la comédie humaine. Ce n'est pas une famille tout à fait
    vieille roche, voyez-vous: au contraire, ça commence dans la
    boue de Provence et finit dans les égouts de Paris; mais elle
    est distinguée, tout de même. Elle a son épilepsie héréditaire,
    belle et forte épilepsie qu'on trouvera partout dans cette
    vingtaine de romans que je suis resolu d'écrire au sujet des
    EGOU-OGWASH. C'est une épilepsie généalogique. Il y en a pour
    toute la famille.</p>

    <h4>II.&mdash;LES POPPOT.</h4>

    <p>JANE POPPOT se promenait sur le Boulevard des Saloperies par
    une belle matinée d'août. En cheveux, panier sur le bras, elle
    allait acheter de la charcuterie pour le déjeuner de son mari,
    oui, son mari pour de bon, chose unique dans la famille OGWASH,
    un vrai mariage à la Mairie et à l'église. Cette petite blonde,
    JANE, a ses idées à elle de se ranger, de vivre en honnête
    femme avec son respectable JEAN POPPOT qui l'adore, au point de
    lui pardonner tout le volume premier de son histoire.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/100.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/100.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Il n'y a pas dans tout Paris ménage plus gentil que le petit
    appartement au septième des POPPOT dans une cité ouvrière de ce
    Betnal Grin Parisien. Tout va bien avec ces braves gens. Lui,
    c'est le Steeple-Jack de Paris, où il fait les réparations de
    tous les toits. Elle, blanchisseuse de fin, a développé un
    secret dans la façon d'empeser les plastrons de chemises. Elle
    fait des plastrons monumentaux, luisants, dur comme l'albâtre.
    Elle a des clients dans le beau monde et à l'étranger, jusqu'au
    Prince de BALEINES, qui lui confie ses chemises de grande
    toilette, celles qu'il porte au diner du Lor Maire, par
    exemple.</p>

    <p>JANE achète sa charcuterie, et après elle s'arrête au coin
    de la rue pour regarder Paris. C'était un tic qu'elle avait, de
    regarder Paris. Cela tenait de la famille OGWASH. Instinct de
    race.</p>

    <p>Paris, vu du hauteur des Saloperies, semble une grande
    marmite pleine de boue et de sang, où les gens grouillent, se
    tordent, s'empiffrent, se dévorent, et <i>squirment</i> dans
    leur propre graisse, comme de la blanchaille sautant dans
    l'huile bouillante. Un nuage de <i>sewer-gaz</i> monte jusqu'à
    JANE stationnée sur la hauteur de Belleville; et dans cette
    brume puante elle sent l'odeur de femmes et de l'ognon, le
    cognac, le meurtre, le fricot, le mont de piété, les omnibus,
    les croquemorts, les gargotes, les bals à l'entrée libre pour
    dames, tout ce qu'il y a de funeste et de choquant dans cette
    ville infecte.</p>

    <p>JANE s'amuse à flairer toutes ces horreurs pendant que le
    pauvre POPPOT danse devant le buffet en attendant l'arlequin ou
    le demi kilo de charcuterie assortie dans le panier de sa
    femme.</p>

    <h4>III.&mdash;DÉGRINGOLADE.</h4>

    <p>Elle a dégringolé. Cela a commencé tout doucement en
    trainant ses savates. Quand une femme dégringole elle traine
    ses savates. C'est une loi universelle. L'on ne dégringole pas
    sans trainer ses savates; l'on ne traine pas ses savates sans
    dégringoler. Ainsi gare aux souliers éculés. O, mais elle est
    changée, cette pauvre p'tite blonde! La maladie héréditaire des
    EGOU-OGWASH vient d'être indiquée. POPPOT, ce brave POPPOT, lui
    aussi il dégringole, il resemble à un réverbère sur le
    boulevard dont on oublie d'éteindre le gaz. Il est allumé du
    matin au soir.</p>

    <p>Ça a commencé si gentiment après que ce bon Steeple-Jack
    était tombé du faîte de Notre Dame, où il faisait des
    réparations. Le pauvre homme a fait cette chute en regardant
    JANE, qui dansait le cancan sur la Place du Parvis pour choquer
    ces crétins de <i>Cook-tourists</i>, et pour distraire son
    mari. C'était pendant la convalescence de POPPOT que la
    dégringolade a commencé. JANE lui donna un dé à coudre de
    vilain cognac, et de ce premier doigt de casse-poitrine à
    l'ivrognerie brutale n'était qu'une glissade, presque aussi
    rapide que la glissade de Notre Dame. POPPOT trainait ses
    savates; il chômait; il rigolait; il gardait le Saint Lundi; il
    passait des journées devant le buffet du Pétrolium, ce grand
    cabaret du peuple où l'on voyait distiller le trois-six pour
    tout le quartier.</p>

    <p>JANE faisait pire que dégringoler; elle cascadait. Elle ne
    se débarbouillait plus. Elle avait pris en horreur le savon.
    Est-ce une aversion héréditaire, datant de la première femme
    qui a senti la puanteur de cet abominable savon français, avant
    la bienfaisante invention de M. POIRES? Sans doute c'était
    l'atavisme en quelque forme. Elle avait son béguin. C'était le
    linge sale. Plus il était sale, plus elle en raffolait. Elle ne
    voulait plus les chemises en batiste fine du Prince de
    BALEINES. Elle priait les aristos du Jockey Club de donner
    leurs plastrons à d'autres. Les clients qu'elle préferait
    étaient les porte-faix, les forts de la halle, les chauffeurs
    du chemin de fer. C'était en allant chercher le linge de ces
    derniers qu'elle entrait sans le savoir dans le Dédale de cette
    voie ferrée qui enlace et écrase les êtres vivants comme les
    grandes roues des locomotives écrasent la poussière de la
    voie.</p>

    <p>Le Président du P.L.M. lui aussi avait son béguin
    héréditaire. Il courait les femmes malpropres. Plus elles ne se
    débarbouillaient pas, plus il les courait. C'était innocent. Il
    les admirait du côté esthétique. Cela tenait de la famille,
    puis de ce que lui aussi était de la vieille souche des
    EGOU-OGWASH. Il s'allumait en lorgnant la figure noircie de
    cette pauvre JANE, et la rencontrant dans la gare un jour il se
    permit un pen de <i>flirtàge</i> sans penser à mal. Mais par
    une fatalité, POPPOT, affreusement paf, descendait d'une
    quatrième classe au moment ou le vieux baisait la main
    crasseuse de JANE, en lui disant son gentil bon soir: et des
    cet instant POPPOT voyait rouge.</p>

    <h4>IV.&mdash;SURINADE.</h4>

    <p>IL voyait rouge. Paris lui semblait un abattoir. Il couvait
    le meurtre, et pour l'aider il avait un complice qui était du
    métier, JACQUES RISPÈRE, conducteur de machines sur le P.L.M.,
    qui avait aussi sa manie héréditaire, et sa manie à lui était
    de couper les gorges. Il les coupait sans rancune, à
    l'improviste, en souriant à sa victime, les yeux dans les yeux.
    Cric! c'était fait. Par exemple il est descendu un jour de la
    locomotive et devant le buffet d'une station où il n'y avait
    pas trop de monde il a suriné la <i>barmaid</i> qui lui
    souriait en lui vendant une brioche. Il a égorgé son chauffeur
    au risque d'arrêter le train de luxe entre Avignon et
    Marseilles. On ne le punit pas. Cela tenait de la famille.</p>

    <p>"Touche là, mon drôle! C'est convenu," dit JACQUES RISPÈRE,
    après un entretien de quelques heures devant le buffet du
    Pétrolium. "Moi, j'arrangerai tout cela avec les
    fonctionnaires. Le train arrivant de Génève doit passer le
    Rapide entre Macon et Dijon. Il ne passera pas. Je retarderai
    le train omnibus arrivant de Marseilles. J'accélererai le
    <i>train-luggage</i> arrivant de Paris. Il y aura une mêlée de
    quatre trains, entrechoqués, tordus, enlacés, faisant le
    <i>pique-à-baque</i>: et pendant cette mêlée j'égorgerai ce
    vieux mufe de Président. C'est simple."</p>

    <p>"Comme bon jour," repondit POPPOT, aveuglément soûl.</p>

    <p>RISPÈRE tenait parole. À onze heures du soir il y avait une
    de ces catastrophes qui font frémir l'Europe voyageuse.
    L'assassin ne <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> s'arrêtait pas à la gorge
       du Président. Le vieil aristo n'avait pas assez de sang pour
       assouvir la soif meurtrière de l'épileptique. RISPÈRE
       égorgea tout le monde, à tort et à travers, une véritable
       tuerie. On le prit les mains rouges, la bouche blanche
       d'écume. C'était la vraie épilepsie d'ESQUIROL.</p>

    <p>Quant à POPPOT personne n'a soupçonné sa complicité dans ce
    crime gigantesque. Lui et JANE se soûlent paisiblement du matin
    an soir devant le buffet du Pétrolium, en amis. Ils deviennent
    tous les jours plus pauvres, plus paresseux, et plus poivres.
    Ainsi c'est facile de prévoir leur fin:&mdash;</p>

    <p>L'hôpital, trente pages de délire alcoölique, et la fosse
    commune.</p>

    <p><i>Note de l'Auteur</i>.&mdash;C'est mon intention
    irrévocable de finir ma vingtaine de romans sur la famille
    OGWASH, et je compte avec plasir offrir les dix-neuf à suivre à
    mon ami estimé, <i>Ponche</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>LISTENING TO THE GENTLE KOOEN.</h2>

    <p><i>Maid Marian</i> is "a Comic Opera in Three Acts," at
    least so I gather from the title-page of the book and from the
    programme of the Prince of Wales's Theatre; though where the
    comicality comes in, except occasionally with Mr. MONKHOUSE, it
    would require <i>Sam Weller's</i> "pair o' patent double
    million magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra power" to detect.
    Mr. LE HAY, too, has nothing like the opportunity which was
    given him in <i>Prince Bulbo</i>. Now, when in a so-called
    Comic Opera your two principal low comedians have very little
    to do, say, or sing, and when that little is not of a
    particularly side-splitting character, and when the plot is not
    replete with comic situations, such a work must depend for its
    success on the freshness of its melodies, on the popularity of
    its <i>artistes</i>, and on the excellence of its
    <i>mise-en-scène</i>.</p>

        </a>Libretto by Smith. As he appears in Act III.,
        "hammering at it."
    </div>

    <p>As to the last of these essentials, if, perhaps, it is not
    so brilliantly placed on the stage as some other shows have
    been, yet there is plenty of Harrisian movement, due always to
    the devices in stage-management of CHARLES of that ilk, who
    certainly knows how to keep the Chorus moving and the game
    alive generally.</p>

    <p>The yet existing admirers of the once enormously popular
    composer, OFFENBACH, among whom I certainly include myself,
    will be much gratified by the delicately introduced
    reminiscences of the work of that master of <i>opéra bouffe</i>
    which occasionally crop up during the performance of <i>Maid
    Marian</i>. If it be permissible for great Masters to repeat
    themselves, as notably more than one has done, may not little
    Masters exhibit the results of their profound studies in the
    schools of popular Composers? Surely they may; and was I not
    pleased with Mr. DE KOOEN (whose name seems to suggest "the
    voice of the turtle,"&mdash;the dove, not the soup) when his
    prelude to the Third Act distinctly recalled to my attentive
    mind the celebrated unison effect in <i>L'Africaine</i>, only
    without the marvellous jump, which, when first heard, thrilled
    the audience, and compelled an enthusiastic encore? Then Miss
    VIOLET CAMERON sang a song about the bells, with a chorus not
    in the least like that in <i>Les Cloches de Corneville</i> you
    understand, because the latter, I think, is performed without
    the bells sounding, but in this there is a musical peal which
    intensifies the distinction between the two. This "number" was
    encored heartily, nay, I think it was demanded three times, and
    came just at the right moment to freshen up the entertainment.
    In the previous Act Miss ATTALIE CLAIRE had had a good song
    which had also obtained an encore, thoroughly well deserved as
    far as her singing was concerned.</p>

    <p>I forget what Mr. COFFIN had to sing, but, whatever it was,
    he did it more than justice, as did also the <i>basso
    profondo</i>, whose efforts in producing his voice from,
    apparently, his boots, were crowned with remarkable
    success.</p>

    <p>The <i>Friar Tuck</i> here is a kind of good old-fashioned
    burlesque Friar, more like that one some years ago at the
    Gaiety, in <i>Little Robin Hood</i> than the Friar in
    <i>Ivanhoe</i>. But I should say that this Friar would be
    uncommonly thankful to have got anything like the song that Sir
    ARTHUR has given <i>his</i> Friar over the way, or something
    even as good as Mr. DALLAS had to sing, years ago, in REECE's
    Gaiety Burlesque. However, perhaps it was not intended for a
    singing part, and perhaps the actor who plays it is not a

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>The Baron thanks Sir HENRY THOMPSON for his <i>Food and
    Feeding</i>, which (published by WARNE &amp; Co., a suggestive
    name) has reached its sixth edition. It is, indeed, an
    entertaining work, and a work that all honest entertainers
    should carefully study. It will delight alike the host and the
    guest. To the first, Sir HENRY, being a host in himself, can
    give such valuable advice as, if acted upon, will secure the
    ready pupil a position as a Lucullus of the first class; and,
    even when so placed, he will still have much to learn from this
    Past Grand Master in the art of living well and wisely. "<i>Fas
    est ab 'hoste' doceri</i>"&mdash;and a better host it would be
    difficult to find as teacher than Sir HENRY THOMPSON, P.G.M.,
    to whose health and happiness the Baron quaffs a bumper of
    burgundy of the right sort and at the right time. Most
    opportunely does this book appear in the season of Lent, which
    may be well and profitably spent in acquiring a thorough
    knowledge of how to turn to the best account the fleshpots of
    Egypt, when the penitential time is past, and the yolk of
    mortification is thrown off with the welcome return of the
    Easter Egg. Read attentively what our guide and friend has to
    say about salads, especially note his remarks on the salad of
    "cold boiled table vegetables." His arrangement of the
    <i>menu</i>, to the Baron's simple taste, humble mode of life,
    and not inconsiderable experience, is perfect. <i>Hors
    d'oeuvres</i> are works of supererogation, and have never been,
    so to speak, acclimatised in our English table-land. The Baron
    may have overlooked any directions about <i>écrivisses</i>, not
    as <i>bisque</i>, but pure and simple as cray-fish, which,
    fresh from the river and served hot and hot come in late but
    welcome as an admirable refresher to the palate, and as a
    relish for the champagne, though the Baron is free to admit
    that the dainty manipulation of them is somewhat of a trial to
    the inexperienced guest, especially in the presence of "Woman,
    lovely Woman." "Hease afore helegance," was <i>Mr. Weller's</i>
    motto, but "Ease combined with elegance" may be attained in a
    few lessons, which any skilled M.D.E. (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Mangeur
    d'écrivisses</i>) will be delighted to give at the
    well-furnished table of an apt and ardent pupil. Once more
    "<i>Your</i> health, Sir HENRY!" that's the Baron's toast
    (bread not permitted) in honour of the eminent practician who
    does so much for the health of everybody.</p>

    <p>That a considerable number of novel-readers like <i>Saint
    Monica</i>, by Mrs. BENNETT-EDWARDS, is evident, because it has
    reached its sixth edition, but that the Baron is not one of
    this happy number he is fain to admit. <i>Saint Monica</i>
    seems to him to be a story with which the author of <i>As in a
    Looking-Glass</i> might have done something in his peculiar
    way. It begins with promise, which promise is not justified by
    performance.</p>

    <p>Who does not welcome the works of HAWLEY SMART, the
    brightest of our novelists? This is not a conundrum, and,
    consequently, has no answer. Everybody likes the books of our
    literary Major, and everybody will be pleased with <i>The
    Plunger</i>. The new Story is in two volumes, and is full of
    incident. There is a murder, which carries one through, from
    the first page to the last, in a state of breathless
    excitement. Not that the tale commences with the tragedy. But
    its anticipation is as delightful as its subsequent
    realisation; and, when the mystery is solved, joy becomes
    universal. The story is told with so light a hand, that it may
    be truly said that the only "heavy" thing about the book is its
    title.</p>

    <p><i>The Autobiography of Joseph Jefferson</i> is a good stout
    volume, full of portraits and interest from beginning to end,
    forming an important addition to the theatrical history of the
    day. The Baron drinks to his old friend, the greatest
    <i>Rip</i> that ever lived. "Here's your health, and your
    family's, and may you live long, and prosper!" says, heartily,
    THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <h2>DUMAS UP TO ARMY ESTIMATES' DATE.</h2>

    <h4>PART I.&mdash;<i>The Three Volunteers.</i></h4>

    <p>LIEUTENANT PORTHOS, Captain ATHOS, and Major ARAMIS were
    delighted with the progress discernible in every detail of the
    battalion to which it was their honour to belong. Not a man
    that did not appear on parade conscious of the fact that he had
    made himself proficient&mdash;the privates were contented, the
    non-commissioned officers happy. It was, indeed, a model
    Regiment. On the occasion of their inspection by Colonel
    D'ARTAGNAN, a man marched from the ranks, and demanded a
    hearing.</p>

    <p>"And what do <i>you</i> want?" asked the inspecting
    officer.</p>

    <p>"We wish the unjust to be made just," returned the
    discontented one. "We ask for a reform."</p>

    <p>PORTHOS, ATHOS, and ARAMIS would have protested, but Colonel
    D'ARTAGNAN motioned them to be silent. "I am here," he
    murmured, "to listen to complaints. I must listen to his."</p>

    <p>"Sir," said the complainant, "we have admirable
    officers&mdash;the Lieutenant, the Captain, and the Major. They
    are always at work."</p>

    <p>"Yes," returned Colonel D'ARTAGNAN; "and so are you."</p>

    <p>"But we have merely to obey orders, and not to command. We
    feel that although we pay for everything connected with the
    battalion, we should do something more. We ought to subscribe a
    sum to pay our excellent officers for commanding us!"</p>

    <p>And PORTHOS, ATHOS, and ARAMIS refused the suggestion, to
    the great disappointment of their subordinates.</p>

    <h4>PART II.&mdash;<i>Twenty Years Afterwards.</i></h4>

    <p>LIEUTENANT PORTHOS, Captain ATHOS, and Major ARAMIS were
    once again being inspected by D'ARTAGNAN, now wearing the gold
    and crimson scarf of a general officer.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I have a complaint to make," replied one of the rank
    and file, in reply to the customary interrogation. "We have
    three officers; but they have merely to give orders, while we
    have to obey them. This is unfair&mdash;unjust. We are always
    at work."</p>

    <p>"Yes," returned General D'ARTAGNAN, "and so are they."</p>

    <p>"True enough. We feel that, although they pay everything for
    the battalion, they should do more. They ought to compensate
    their excellent privates for the time we devote to obeying
    them."</p>

    <p>And PORTHOS, ATHOS, and ARAMIS accepted the suggestion, to
    the great delight of their subordinates.</p>

    <h4>PART III.&mdash;<i>Ten Years Later.</i></h4>

    <p>Lieutenant PORTHOS, Captain ATHOS, and Major ARAMIS were yet
    again on parade.</p>

    <p>"I salute you, my friends," said Field Marshal D'ARTAGNAN,
    the inspecting officer. "But where is your Regiment?"</p>

    <p>PORTHOS looked at ATHOS, and ATHOS glanced at ARAMIS. Then
    they replied in a breath, "It has been disbanded."</p>

    <p>"Disbanded!" echoed D'ARTAGNAN. "But where are the accounts
    of the Corps?"</p>

    <p>Then the three friends replied in a mournful tone, "Filed in
    the Court of Bankruptcy!"</p>

    <p>"And what do you call this filing of officers' accounts in
    the Court of Bankruptcy?"</p>

    <p>"We call it the last act of the Volunteer Movement, which,
    by the way, however, was not entirely voluntary!"</p>

    <p>And the four friends having no further occupation requiring
    their joint attention, shook hands warmly, and parted&mdash;for
    ever!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, February
    16</i>.&mdash;After long tarrying, House once more justified
    its old character. Been dolefully dull these weeks and months
    past. Thought it was dead; only been sleeping. To-night woke
    up, and audience that filled every Bench, blocked the Gangways,
    and thronged the Bar, had rare treat. Occasion was the
    indictment of Prince ARTHUR; long pending; was to have come off
    at beginning of Session; put off on account of counter
    attractions in Committee-Room No. 15; postponement no longer
    possible; and here we are, House throbbing with excitement, OLD
    MORALITY nervously clacking about Treasury Bench, bringing his
    chicks together under his wing. RANDOLPH brought his young
    beard down to witness performance.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:28%;">
        <a href="images/107-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/107-1.png"
             alt="A Buffer Q.C." /></a>A Buffer Q.C.
    </div>

    <p>Initial difficulty in Irish Camp; Brer FOX sitting in old
    place, two steps down third bench below Gangway. Brer RABBIT,
    sunk in profound meditation, oblivious to the rival Leader's
    presence, occupies corner seat; room for one between them. Who
    shall take it? Anxious time for TIM HEALY. Nothing he dreads so
    much as possibility of outbreak. In Committee-Room No. 15, Brer
    FOX snatched out of Brer RABBIT's hand a sheet of paper.
    Suppose now, in sudden paroxysm, he were to reach forth and
    taking Brer RABBIT by the beard bang his head against the back
    of the Bench? TIM's gentle nature shivered with apprehension;
    thing to do was to get a good plump gentleman set between the
    two, so that in case hostilities broke out his body might be
    used as buffer. Thought of ELTON first. Besides a professional
    desire to find occupation for Members of the Bar, ELTON's
    figure seemed made on purpose for the peaceful errand TIM had
    in mind. Broached subject. ELTON said, always happy to oblige;
    but was, in fact, just now retiring from Parliamentary life;
    didn't care to be brought into undue prominence. Besides, he
    belonged to other side of House; Why not try T.B. POTTER?</p>

    <p>"The very man!" cried TIM, "I believe you and he scale the
    same to a pound, and though your waist is more shapely, he has
    the advantage in shoulders."</p>

    <p>POTTER most obliging of men; offered no objection. So TIM
    conducted him to the seat; he dropped gently, but firmly in it;
    Brer RABBIT putting on his spectacles, and looking across the
    expanse of T.B.'s shoulders, thought he recognised Brer FOX at
    the other side. Anyhow, he was beyond speaking distance, and so
    embarrassment was obviated.</p>

    <p>TIM, his mind thus at rest, able to devote his attention to
    debate, to progress of which, he contributed a few
    interjections. Finally, when Division taken on JOHN MORLEY's
    Motion, and everybody ready to go home, he moved and carried
    Adjournment of Debate.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Prince ARTHUR indicted for
    breach of Constitutional Law in Ireland. Jury retired to
    consider their verdict. Agreed upon acquittal by 320 Votes
    against 245.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;A once familiar presence pervades
    House to-night. Everyone more, or less vaguely, conscious of
    it. Even without chancing to look up to Peers' Gallery, Members
    are inspired with sudden mysterious access of Moral Influence.
    OLD MORALITY himself, that overflowing reservoir of moral
    axioms, takes on an aggravated air of responsibility and
    respectability. Has had a great triumph which would inflate a
    man of less modest character. Last night, or rather early this
    morning, Irish Members appeared to force Government hand; just
    when it seemed that RUSSELL's Amendment was about to be
    substituted for MORLEY's Resolution, TIM HEALY interposed,
    moved Adjournment of Debate; OLD MORALITY protested; SEXTON
    slily threatened all-night sitting; after an hour's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> struggle, Government
       capitulated; Adjournment agreed to; Irish Members went off
       jubilant.</p>

    <p>To-night SEXTON asks OLD MORALITY when they shall resume
    debate?</p>

    <p>"Ah," says OLD MORALITY, with look of friendly interest, as
    if the idea had struck him for the first time, "yes; just so.
    The Hon. Member wants to know when we shall resume the debate,
    the adjournment of which he and his friends were instrumental
    in carrying at an early hour this morning. Well, I must say, on
    the part of Her Majesty's Government, that we are perfectly
    satisfied with matters as they were left. We had a lively
    debate, a majority much larger than we had dared to hope for,
    and, as far as we are concerned, I think we'll leave matters
    alone. As one of our great prose-writers observed, it is, on
    the whole, more conducive to comfort to endure any
    inconveniences that may press upon one at the current moment,
    than to hasten to encounter others with the precise nature of
    which we do not happen to be acquainted."</p>

    <p>GRAND CROSS missed this delightful little episode, not
    coming in till questions were over. Now he sat in Peers'
    Gallery and gazed through spectacles on scene of earlier
    triumphs. Looks hardly a day older than when he left us; the
    same perky manner, the same wooden visage, with its pervading
    air of supreme self-satisfaction and inscrutable wisdom. It is
    a night given up to Indian topics. PLOWDEN, in his quiet,
    effective way, has just carried Motion which will have
    substantial effect in the direction of securing fuller debate
    of Indian questions. GORST, standing at table replying to
    BUCHANAN on another Indian topic, alludes with deferential tone
    to "the SECRETARY OF STATE." GRAND CROSS almost audibly purrs
    from his perch in the Gallery.</p>

    <p>"An odd world, my masters," says the Member for SARK,
    striding out impatiently, "when you have a man like GORST
    Under-Secretary, with a man like GRAND CROSS at the Head of the
    Department."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;An hour or two given to
    India.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Army Estimates on to-night. HANBURY
    comes to the front, as usual. STANHOPE tossing about on
    Treasury Bench, in considerable irritation.</p>

    <p>"What's the use, my ST. JOHN," he asked BRODRICK, the only
    man standing by him, "of a family arrangement like ours, if one
    is subjected to annoyance like this? With one brother in the
    Peers, a pillar of staid Conservatism; with myself on the
    Treasury Bench, a Cabinet Minister, a right-hand man of the
    Government: and then, final touch, old PHILIP EGALITÉ below the
    Gangway opposite, with his Radicalism, and his tendency to
    out-JACOBY LABOUCHERE. This is a broad-based family
    combination, that ought to make us, each in his way,
    irresistible. And yet there seems nothing to prevent a fellow
    like HANBURY looking down from his six feet two scornfully on a
    British soldier not more than five feet four in his
    stocking-feet, whilst he inflates his chest, and asks, in
    profound bass notes, how are the ancient glories of the British
    Army to be maintained with men who cannot stretch the tape at
    thirty-six inches?"</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/108-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/108-2.png"
             alt="'Amazed at his own Moderation.'" /></a>"Amazed at
             his own Moderation."
    </div>

    <p>When HANBURY sat down, after pounding away in ponderous
    style for nearly an hour, STANHOPE got up and prodded him
    reproachfully. Wonderful how much vinegar and vitriol he
    managed to distil into his oft-repeated phrase, "My honourable
    friend!" As for HANBURY, he sat with hands in pocket, staring
    at empty benches opposite, amazed at his own moderation.</p>

    <p>Hours of the usual kind of talk on Army Estimates; the
    Colonels, Volunteer and otherwise, showing that the Army is as
    GILL (who has recently spent some time in Boulogne) says, <i>en
    route pour les chiens</i>; the SECRETARY of State for WAR
    demonstrating that everything is in apple-pie order, and his
    right honourable predecessor on the Front Opposition Bench
    bearing testimony to the general state of efficiency.</p>

    <p>WOLMER flashed through the haze a word that has long wanted
    saying in the House. Why, he asked, place sentries surrounding
    St. James's Palace, the War Office, and the Horse Guards? Why,
    if presence of armed men at these particular gateways is
    essential to proper conduct of affairs of Department&mdash;why
    should Charity Commissioners and Education Office be left
    unguarded? WOLMER should keep pegging away at this question
    till he gets common-sense answer.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Army Estimates moved.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Gallant little Wales took the floor
    to-night. Wants the Church Disestablished; PRITCHARD MORGAN, in
    speech of prodigious length, asked House to sanction the
    proposal. The Government, determined to oppose Motion, cast
    about for Member of their body who could best lead opposition.
    Hadn't a Welshman on the Treasury Bench.</p>

    <p>"There's RAIKES, you know," AKERS-DOUGLAS said, discussing
    the matter with OLD MORALITY. "He's not exactly a Welshman,
    but, when he's at home, he lives in Denbighshire, which is as
    near being Wales as you can get. Besides, his postal address is
    Llwynegrin."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said OLD MORALITY, "that looks well. He's not the
    rose, but he lives in convenient contiguity to the flower."</p>

    <h2>OUT OF SCHOOL!</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;You are so awfully good to chaps at
    school that I am sure you will insert this letter. SMITH MINOR,
    who takes in the <i>Times</i>, says, that a "PARENT" has been
    writing to say, that there should be a meeting of Fathers to
    swagger over the meeting of Head Masters. Well, this wouldn't
    be half a bad idea if it were properly conducted; but the
    "PARENT" seems to be a beast of a governor, who wants to cut
    down the holidays, and such like rot. And this brings me to
    what I want to propose myself. If there are to be meetings of
    Head Masters and Parents, why not a meeting of Boys? We have a
    heap of grievances. For instance, lots of chaps would like to
    know why "the water" was stopped at Westminster, and something
    about the domestic economy of Harrow. Then the great and
    burning question of grub is always ready to hand. The "PARENT"
    wants to have a hand in the payment for school-books, seeing
    his way to getting the discount (stingy chap!) then why
    shouldn't we fellows have a voice choosing them? Then about
    taking up Greek, why shouldn't we have our say in <i>that</i>
    matter? After all, it interests us more than anyone else, as we
    are the fellows that will have to learn it, if it is to be
    retained. Then about corporal punishment. Not that we mind it
    much, still <i>we</i> are the fellows who get swished at Eton,
    and feel the tolly at Beaumont. Surely the Boys know more about
    a licking than Head Masters and Parents? You, as a practical
    man, will say, "Who should attend the Congress?" I reply, every
    public school might send a delegate; and by public school, I do
    not limit the term to the old legitimate "E. and the two W.'s,"
    Eton, Winchester and Westminster. No; I would throw it open to
    such respectable educational establishments as Harrow, Rugby,
    Charterhouse, St. Paul's, Marlborough, Felsted, Cheltenham,
    Stonyhurst, and the rest of them. The more the merrier, say I;
    and if there was a decided division of opinion on any subject,
    we could settle the matter off-hand at once, by taking off our
    jackets and turning up our shirt-sleeves. The more I think of
    it, the more I like it! It <i>would</i> be a game!</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
